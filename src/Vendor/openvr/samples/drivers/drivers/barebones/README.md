Refer to the `samples/` README for how to build this driver.  

This driver only includes a `IServerTrackedDeviceProvider` and does not add any devices to SteamVR.  

The driver will log an initialization message to the console, which can be found here when SteamVR is open: http://localhost:27062/console/index.html
